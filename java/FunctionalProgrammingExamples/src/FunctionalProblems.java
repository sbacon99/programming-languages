		// save in an integer variable called "answer"
		
		// Problem 2) Save only the strings in "coll2" that are more than 
		// one character long. The result should be saved in a List of Strings called
		// "longWords"
		
		// Problem 3) Using "coll2", make a String that combines all entries with ","
		// (so, create a String with "a, b, hey, yes" in this example and print it)
		
		// Problem 4) Using "coll2", identify the number of words which are longer
		// than one character and save that number in an integer called "longWordsCount"
		
		// Problem 5) Using "coll2", sum the length of all the words in the Collection
		// Store the result in "longWordsSum" and print it
		
		// We will now go over functional programming slides and revisit/rework these
